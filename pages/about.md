## About the Collection

Our project is “A Visual Postcard of Arizona’s Historical Sites” which connects four different collections.

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital). 

For full details of creating your own collection site, visit [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/)!

## Collection History

The San Xavier del Bac Mission is also known as the “White Dove of the Desert”, is located in Tucson Arizona on the Tohono O’odham Nation Indian Reservation. The 
mission was founded by Padre Eusebio Kino (Father Kino) in 1692. The mission continues to serve people today as a place of worship and sanctuary. Digital resources from this collection may include images of the inside and outside of the Mission.
