## About the Collection

Our project is “A Visual Postcard of Arizona’s Historical Sites” which connects four different collections.

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital). 

For full details of creating your own collection site, visit [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/)!

## Collection History

The Coronado Trail is the first Federal Highway in the United States. It connected the state in ways never before seen and is a way to view the beauty Arizona has to offer. The Coronado Trail follows the path theorized to have been used by Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in 1540 as he searched for the fabled “Seven Cities of Cibola.” (Coronado Trail, n.d.). Digital resources from this collection may include images from along the
trail, a map of the trail, images of wildlife, and historic markers.

The San Xavier del Bac Mission is also known as the “White Dove of the Desert”, is located in Tucson Arizona on the Tohono O’odham Nation Indian Reservation. The 
mission was founded by Padre Eusebio Kino (Father Kino) in 1692. The mission continues to serve people today as a place of worship and sanctuary. Digital resources from this collection include images of the inside and outside of the Mission.

The Grand Canyon is considered one of the most iconic and most visited sites in Arizona. The historical, cultural, and geographical significance of the Grand Canyon make it a perfect addition to the visual postcard of historic Arizona. Digital resources from this collection include images of the Grand Canyon, sounds of wildlife, and a map.

Many outposts, camps, and forts were built to protect settlers and communities from outlaws and Indigenous communities. One example of this is the Fort Defiance collection. Fort Defiance is in Apache County near the New Mexicoborder. Digital resources for this collection include images of the Fort, and an oral history of the restoration of the Fort.
